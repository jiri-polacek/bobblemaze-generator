This is an original Bobblemaze generator coded in Octave.

Bobblemaze is a number-based logic puzzle. The objective is to determine an orthogonal string of all unique positive numbers – the bobble – in a matrix that varies in shape – the maze. The bobble consists of adjacent numbers (in vertical or horizontal positions only) starting with the number 1 and terminating with the maximum valued number within the maze. The number zero is never a part of the bobble.
